    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists often study settings where units possess two or more group memberships, some of which can change over time. A prominent example comes from Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (henceforth AKM) who proposed a panel model of log wage determination that is additive in worker and firm fixed effects. This so-called “two-way” fixed effects or \"AKM\" model takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\ty_{{g} t} =  \\alpha_{{g}} + \\psi_{j({g},t)} + w_{{g} t}'\\delta +  \\varepsilon_{{g} t}  \\qquad({g}=1,\\dots,N, \\ t=1,\\dots,T_{g} \\ge 2)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the function $j(\\cdot ,\\cdot ):\\lbrace 1,\\dots ,N\\rbrace \\times \\lbrace 1,\\dots ,\\max_g T_g \\rbrace \\to \\lbrace 0,\\dots ,J\\rbrace$  allocates each of $n=\\sum_{g=1}^N T_g$ person-year observations to one of $J+1$ firms. Here $\\alpha_g$ is a person effect, $\\psi_{j(g,t)}$ is a firm effect, $w_{gt}$ is a time-varying covariate, and $\\varepsilon_{gt}$ is a time-varying error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that can we simply rewrite the original AKM model as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y_i =x_i^{\\prime } \\beta +\\varepsilon_i \\qquad i=1,...,n\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ indexes a particular person $g$ year $t$ observation, $x_i$ is a vector that collects all the worker, firm dummies as well as the time-varying covariates $w_{gt}$ so that $\\beta =(\\alpha ,\\psi ,\\delta )'$ is a $k\\times 1$ vector that collects all the worker, firm fixed effects along with $\\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest in AKM models often centers on understanding how much of the variability in log wages is attributable to firms. It is common to summarize the firm contribution to wage inequality using the following two variance components parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\psi }^2 =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{g=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_g } {\\left(\\psi_{j\\left(g,t\\right)} -\\bar{\\psi} \\right)}^2 \\qquad \\text{and }\\sigma_{\\alpha ,\\psi } =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{g=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_g } \\left(\\psi_{j\\left(g,t\\right)} -\\bar{\\psi} \\right)\\alpha_g \t\t\t\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{\\psi} =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{g=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_g } \\psi_{j(g,t)}$. The variance component $\\sigma_{\\psi }^2$ measures the contribution of firm wage variability to inequality, while the covariance component $\\sigma_{\\alpha ,\\psi }$ measures the additional contribution of systematic sorting of high wage workers to high wage firms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `leave_out_KSS` provides unbiased estimates of $\\sigma_{\\psi }^2$ and $\\sigma_{\\alpha ,\\psi }$ as well as an estimate of $\\sigma_{\\alpha }^2 =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{g=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_g } {\\left(\\alpha_g -\\bar{\\alpha} \\right)}^2$ using the leave-out bias correction approach proposed by KSS. In what follows, we use the words \"workers\" and \"firms\" when describing the procedure for simplicity but the the function `leave_out_KSS` can be applied to any two-way models (e.g. patients and doctors, students and teachers, strata and treatment arms).\n",
    "\n",

    "We now demonstrate the functioning of `leave_out_KSS` with a simple example. \n",

The code provides some summary statistics (e.g. # of movers, # of firms, mean and variance of the outcome, etc) for the  leave-out connected set.\n",

The code starts by reporting the --- biased --- estimates of the variance components that result from the \"plug-in\" approach of treating OLS estimates as measured without error. Finally, the code prints the bias corrected variance of firm effects and covariance of worker, firm effects."

The fourth column reports the statistical leverages of the AKM model. If the code is reporting a leave-out correction at the match-level, the .csv will be collapsed at the match level.
