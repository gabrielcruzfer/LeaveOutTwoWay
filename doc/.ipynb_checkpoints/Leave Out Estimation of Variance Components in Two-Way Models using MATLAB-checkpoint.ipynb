    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists often study settings where units possess two or more group memberships, some of which can change over time. A prominent example comes from Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) (henceforth AKM) who proposed a panel model of log wage determination that is additive in worker and firm fixed effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This so-called “two-way” fixed effects or \"AKM\" model takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\ty_{gt} =  \\alpha_{{g}} + \\psi_{j({g},t)} + w_{gt}'\\delta +  \\varepsilon_{gt}  \\qquad({g}=1,\\dots,N, \\ t=1,\\dots,T_{g} \\ge 2)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the function $j(\\cdot ,\\cdot ):\\lbrace 1,\\dots ,N\\rbrace \\times \\lbrace 1,\\dots ,\\max_i T_g \\rbrace \\to \\lbrace 1,\\dots ,J\\rbrace$  assigns a worker $g$ and year $t$ observation to one of $J$ firms. Here $\\alpha_g$ is a person effect, $\\psi_{j(g,t)}$ is a firm effect, $w_{gt}$ is a time-varying covariate, and $\\varepsilon_{gt}$ is a time-varying error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that can we simply rewrite the original AKM model as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y_i =x_i^{\\prime } \\beta +\\varepsilon_i \\qquad i=1,...,n\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ indexes a particular person-year observation $(g,t)$, $x_i$ is a vector that collects all the worker, firm dummies as well as the time-varying covariates $w_{gt}$ so that $\\beta =(\\alpha ,\\psi ,\\delta )'$ is a $k\\times 1$ vector that collects all the worker, firm fixed effects along with $\\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest in AKM models often centers on understanding how much of the variability in log wages is attributable to firms. It is common to summarize the firm contribution to wage inequality using the following two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\psi }^2 =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{g=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_g } {\\left(\\psi_{j\\left(g,t\\right)} -\\bar{\\psi} \\right)}^2 \\qquad \\text{and }\\sigma_{\\alpha ,\\psi } =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{g=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_g } \\left(\\psi_{j\\left(g,t\\right)} -\\bar{\\psi} \\right)\\alpha_g\t\t\t\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{\\psi} =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{g=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_g } \\psi_{j(g,t)}$. The variance component $\\sigma_{\\psi }^2$ measures the contribution of firm wage variability to inequality, while the covariance component $\\sigma_{\\alpha ,\\psi }$ measures the additional contribution of systematic sorting of high wage workers to high wage firms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `leave_out_KSS` provides unbiased estimates of $\\sigma_{\\psi }^2$ and $\\sigma_{\\alpha ,\\psi }$ as well as an estimate of $\\sigma_{\\alpha }^2 =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{g=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^{T_g } {\\left(\\alpha_g -\\bar{\\alpha} \\right)}^2$ using the leave-out bias correction approach proposed by KSS. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The KSS Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "We now provide some general intuition about the KSS leave-out methodology. A more formal discussion can be found in the ECTA article.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Plug-in Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the researcher is interested in the variance of firm effects, $\\sigma_{\\psi }^2$. To simplify the exposition, we normalize the firm effects so that their firm-size weighted mean is equal to zero, i.e. $\\bar{\\psi}=0$ and re-write $\\sigma_{\\psi }^2$ as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\psi }^2 =\\frac{1}{J}\\sum_{j=1}^J s_{j}\\psi^{2}_{j}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s_{j}$ gives the total number of worker-year observations associated with firm $j$, i.e. $s_{j}=\\sum_{g=1}^{N}\\sum_{t=1}^{T_{g}}\\mathbf{1}\\{j(g,t)=j\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is customary to report \"plug-in\" estimates of a given variance component using the corresponding OLS estimate. For instance, the plug-in estimate of the variance of firm effects $\\sigma_{\\psi }^2$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tilde{\\sigma}_{\\psi}^2=\\frac{1}{J}\\sum_{j=1}^J s_{j}\\hat{\\psi}^{2}_{j}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}$ is the OLS estimate obtained after estimating equation (1) via OLS. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bias in the Plug-in Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated firm effect, $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}$, represents a noisy estimate of the true firm effect, $\\psi_{j}$. The presence of noise in $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}$ is not an issue when one is interested in $\\psi_{j}$ as the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}$ is assumed to be unbiased in this context, i.e. $E[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}]=\\psi_{j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, estimation error in $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}$ is going to lead to biases when estimating $\\psi_{j}^{2}$ using its \"plug-in\" analogue $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}^{2}$ since:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}^{2}]=E[(\\hat{\\psi}_{j}-\\psi_{j}+\\psi_{j})^2]=\\psi^{2}+\\underbrace{\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}]}_{\\text{Bias}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}]$ is the squared standard error of $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}$. Intuitively, when we take the square of $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}$ we are not only squaring its signal, $\\psi_{j}$, but also the estimation error in each $\\hat{\\psi}_{j}$. The latter is going to introduce a bias when estimating $\\psi^{2}_{j}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The same logic applies when analyzing the bias of the plug-in estimator of the variance of firm effects since\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E[\\tilde{\\sigma}_{\\psi}^2]=\\sigma^{2}_{\\psi}+\\underbrace{\\dfrac{1}{J}\\sum_{j=1}^{J}s_{j}{\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}]}}_{\\text{Bias}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with \"Standard\" Standard Errors in High Dimensional Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula above shows that the bias of the plug-in estimator of the variance of firm effects is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E[\\tilde{\\sigma}_{\\psi}^2]-\\sigma^{2}_{\\psi}=\\dfrac{1}{J}\\sum_{j=1}^{J}s_{j}{\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}]}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, all that is required for a bias correction is an estimate of the (squared) standard error of each firm effect, ${\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}]}$. Similarly, if our interest is on the variance of person effects, then we would need the standard error on each of the person effects, ${\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\alpha}_{i}]}$. If we are interested in the covariance of worker and firm effects, then we would need the covariances in sampling errors between each $\\hat{\\alpha}_{i}$ and $\\hat{\\psi}_{j(i,t)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion above highlights that an estimate of the sampling variability of the OLS coefficient vector $\\hat{\\beta}=(\\hat{\\alpha},\\hat{\\psi},\\hat{\\delta})$ is required in order to derive an unbiased estimate of the variance components of the AKM model displayed in equation (2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the sampling variability in $\\hat{\\beta}$, assuming independence across observations, is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "{\\mathbb{{V}}}[\\hat{\\beta}]=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}'\\right)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}x_{i}x_{i}'\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}'\\right)^{-1}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma^{2}_{i}=Var(\\varepsilon_{i})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can be tempted to provide an estimate of $\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\beta}]$ using heteroskedatic *consistent* (\"HC\" or robust), standard errors.  HC standard-errors are calculated using a simple plug-in estimate of $\\sigma^{2}_{i}$ based on\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tilde{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}=(y_{i}-x_{i}'\\hat{\\beta})^2.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "so that the HC based estimate of $\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\beta}]$ is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tilde{\\mathbb{{V}}}[\\hat{\\beta}]=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}'\\right)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\tilde{{\\sigma}}^{2}_{i}x_{i}x_{i}'\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}'\\right)^{-1}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, HC standard errors based on $\\tilde{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}$  are inconsistent in any high dimensional model where the number of parameters is proportional to the sample size. This corresponds to our context as we often have a firm effect that is estimated using less than 5 observations or \"moves\" of workers across employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Leave Out Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "KSS provide an heteroskedastic-*unbiased* (HU) estimate of the standard error of any coefficient obtained from a high-dimensional linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KSS HU standard error estimate is based on a leave-out estimate of $\\sigma^{2}_{i}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}=y_{i}(y_{i}-x_{i}'\\hat{\\beta}_{-i}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\beta}_{-i}$ is the OLS estimate of $\\beta$ from equation (2) after leaving observation $i$ out. \n",
    "\n",
    "KSS then replaces $\\sigma^{2}_{i}$ in $\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\beta}]$ with its unbiased estimate $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}$ to derive a HU estimate of $\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\beta}]:$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{\\mathbb{{V}}}[\\hat{\\beta}]=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}'\\right)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\hat{{\\sigma}}^{2}_{i}x_{i}x_{i}'\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}x_{i}'\\right)^{-1}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the example of the variance of the firm effects, we can extract from $\\hat{\\mathbb{V}}[\\hat{\\beta}]$ the corresponding squared standard error of each firm effect, $\\mathbb{V}^{HU}[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}]$. We can then use the latter to bias correct the corresponding estimate of the variance of the firm effects as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{\\psi}=\\tilde{\\sigma}^{2}_{\\psi}-\\dfrac{1}{J}\\sum_{j=1}^{J}s_{j}{\\mathbb{V}[\\hat{\\psi}_{j}]}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The MATLAB function `leave_out_KSS` is going to print the bias corrected variance of firm effects, $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{\\psi}$, as well as the bias-corrected covariance of worker and firm effects and variance of person effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Computing the KSS Correction\n",
    "We now demonstrate how one can implement the KSS correction in two-way models using MATLAB and the function `leave_out_KSS`. We continue to work with a simple example based on an AKM model. In what follows, we use the words \"workers\" and \"firms\" when describing the procedure for simplicity but the the function `leave_out_KSS` can be applied to any two-way models (e.g. patients and doctors, students and teachers, strata and treatment arms).\n",

We now discuss briefly the main computational bottleneck of the procedure and the JLA algorithm. \n",

    "## Computational Bottleneck\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the discussion in Section 1 that the KSS leave-out bias correction procedure relies on leave-out estimates of $\\sigma^{2}_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}=y_{i}(y_{i}-x_{i}'\\hat{\\beta}_{-i})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\beta}_{-i}$ is the OLS estimate of $\\beta$ from the AKM model in equation (2) after leaving observation $i$ out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, re-estimating $\\hat{\\beta}_{-i}$ by leaving a particular observation $i$ for $n$ times, is infeasible computationally. Luckily, one can re-write $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}=y_{i}\\frac{(y_{i}-x_{i}'\\hat{\\beta})}{1-P_{ii}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{ii}$ measures the influence or leverage of observation $i$, i.e. $P_{ii} =x_i^{\\prime } S_{xx}^{-1} x_i$. The expression above highlights that all that is needed for computation of $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{i}$ are the $n$ statistical leverages $\\{P_{ii}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$. \n",
    "However, exact computation of $P_{ii}$ might still remain prohibitive when $n$ is in order of tens of millions or higher. \n",
